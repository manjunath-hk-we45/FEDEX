# RECONNAISSANCE

      ðŸ”¦ Reconnaissance is process in which we gather information about the application, and also the host/client on which the application is running. To understand its functional and non functional requirements. 

Recon can be done at different levels of the computing environment for a thick client :

* **Application level**
* **Host level**
* **Storage level**
* **Network level**

### ðŸ’  Application Level

1. Improper error handling
2. SQL Injection
3. Parameter Tampering
4. File Upload
5. Insecure storage
6. Broken authentication & Session management
7. Business Logic
8. Denial of service
9. Buffer overflow 
10. Digital signature verification \(SignTool\)

### ðŸ’ Host Level 

1. Cracking windows system Password
2. Windows system  Privilege Escalation
3. DLL Injection

### ðŸ’ Storage Level 

1. Logs
2. Cache files 
3. Configuration files

### ðŸ’ Network Level

1. Intercept network calls \(HTTP, TCP or Sockets communication \)

Some of the information we can get during this process are:

* Application structure,  design, functionality and the way its built \(Technology stack\)
* File and folder access done by the application
* Application Network traffic to understand its communication with the server
* Scanning for sensitive data stored in the application package, as application might have some information disclosure.
* Information gathering regarding host is also important as we can check if we can exploit host vulnerability to exploit an application
